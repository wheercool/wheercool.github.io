1. For each department will be generated individual tab? or I shoul add another filter on the client side?
2. Which question should answer first widget?
Is it helpfull for clients?
Clients want to know average duration of their feature examination, so should I use examination type or examination group? In this case speedos are not suitable anymore.
Client can see average duration for each step and total duration.
For each examintaion type group the sequance of the steps can be different.

Examination group can be used as aditional filter.
