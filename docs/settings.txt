Hi guys,

I can provide you following settings:

Each widget will have 3 mandatory fields:
* name - identity of the widget
* title - the title of the panel

Process Insight Widget:
* Path to the process icon (by default we can use name convention: the name of the step equals to the name of the icon) 
* The color of the delay value (per type) 
* The background color of the header (per type) 
* The background color of the step
* Path to the status icon (per type)
P.S. type can take the following values: ok, bad and good depends on the duration value of the step.

Departament Insight Widget:
* Path to the hospital icon
* Color palette for the "per type"/ "per employee" pie charts
* Max number of the splices visible on "per type"/"per employee" pie charts (other will be grouped in category "Other")

Waiting Room Widget:
* Color for each sector of the speedo

Please, add to the list what you want to see more or remove unnecessary features.

To simplify all the settings I will use default value for each setting (except 3 mandatory) and you can omit all of them to get the current design.

Unfortunately, I will not be available online up to the Sunday, but will keep working on this.

BR, 
Alex
